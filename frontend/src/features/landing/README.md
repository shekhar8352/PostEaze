# Landing Feature

The landing feature provides the main entry point and homepage functionality for the PostEaze application. This feature handles the initial user experience and serves as the gateway to the application's core functionality.

## Architecture

The landing feature follows the standard feature-based architecture pattern used throughout the application, with clear separation between components, pages, and routing configuration.

## Contents

### Core Files
- **`index.tsx`** - Feature barrel export that exposes the landing routes
- **`landingRoutes.tsx`** - React Router configuration for landing-related routes

### Components
- **`components/Navbar/`** - Navigation bar component used across landing pages
  - Simple navbar component providing basic navigation structure

### Pages
- **`pages/Landing Page/`** - Main landing page implementation
  - Root landing page component that serves as the application homepage
  - Integrates the Navbar component for consistent navigation

## Routing Structure

The landing feature defines the following routes:

```typescript
const landingRoutes: RouteObject[] = [
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <LandingPage />,
  },
];
```

- **`/`** - Root path that renders the main landing page

## Component Hierarchy

```
LandingPage
└── Navbar
```

The landing page serves as the main container that incorporates the navigation component to provide a consistent user interface.

## Usage

The landing feature is automatically integrated into the application's routing system through the main routes configuration. The feature exports its routes via the barrel export pattern:

```typescript
// From index.tsx
export { default as landingRoutes } from "./landingRoutes";
```

## Key Features

- **Homepage Rendering** - Provides the main entry point for users visiting the application
- **Navigation Integration** - Includes navbar component for consistent site navigation
- **Route Configuration** - Defines routing structure for landing-related pages

## Development Notes

- The landing page currently has a minimal implementation with basic navbar integration
- Components follow React functional component patterns with TypeScript
- The feature is structured to support easy expansion with additional landing-related pages and components
